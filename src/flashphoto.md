Getting Started with FlashPhoto {#flashphoto}
===========

1. Brushes
-----------

There are 8 brushes(tools) used in the Flashphoto program. Pen, calligraphy pen, chalk, highlighter, spray can, blur, eraser and stamp are the brushes that can be applied.

To use these tools, simply run the FlashPhoto program and there are lists of tools at the left menu. By clicking the tools that you want to use, the tool is utilized and you can not simply draw on the canvas. You can also choose lots of different colors for the tools and sizes.

###Pen###

Pen tool is a tool that makes user to draw on the canvas with the actual pen. The characteristic of this tool is that it makes circular mark and the intensity of each pixel drawn is equal.

###Calligraphy Pen###

Calligraphy pen is a tool is similar as pen that it has constant intensity when drawn on the canvas. The uniqueness of this tool compared to the tool pen is that the mask is an oval tilted at a 30 degree. So by looking at the sample image, it can be found that calligraphy pen looks different with pen at the starting and end point.

###Chalk###

Chalk tool is designed to be similar as actual chalk that we use on real life. This tool also have circular mask but 40% of the pixels are randomly chonsen.

###Highlighter###

Highlighter tool is designed to look like a highlighter pen. The shape is quite similar with calligraphy pen but the oval is vertically and semi-transparent. 40% of the highlighter color and 60% of the colors that are already on canvas are applied.

###Spray Can###

Spray can tool also looks similar as the spray can that people use when drawing on the wall. This tool has circular shape as well and center point has the strongest intensity.

###Blur###

Blur tool is a tool that makes some drawings or images to be blurred. To use the blur tool, simply click the blur and drag on the drawings or images. As shown above, the part that user dragged on the image will be blurred. This is different with the filter blur which blurs the entire canvas.

###Eraser###

Eraser tool works like an eraser. This can remove the drawings or images on the canvas by dragging on the part that user wants to remove.

###Stamp###

Stamp is a tool that user can make a stamp mark on the canvas. It can be applied on the blank canvas and on the images.

2. Filters
-----------

There are 8 Filters used in the FlashPhoto program. Blur, Motion Blur, Sharpen, Edge Detect, Threshold, Saturate, Channels(adjusting R, G, B) and Quantize.

Similar as Tools, you can simply click on the filters that you want and select the amount of strength that you want to apply for the chosen filters. Depending on the amount that you chose, it might take some time for filters to be applied.

Below pictures show the obvious comparison between original and filtered images

###Original###

This is the original drawing sample by using basic tools. This might help to understand how the filters work by comparing with the filtered image below.

###Blur Filter###

Blur filter is the filter that makes the entire canvas image or drawings to be blurred. By controlling the intensity of the amount, users can give variety strength of blurs on the image. The caution is that when the amount is getting bigger, it takes longer time for the effect to come out.

###Motion Blur Filter###

Motion Blur filter is almost same with blur filter. The uniqueness of the motion blur filter is that the direction of the blur effect can be given. There are 4 directions that can be chosen. North-South, East-West, NorthEast-SouthWest and NorthWest-SouthEast. Only by looking at the result image, it might be a bit confused but if the user look at the moment when the blur effect is given, it becomes more obvious.

###Sharpen Filter###

Sharpen filter is the filter that gives the strength on the image edges. For example, by looking at the below image, we can find that the edges became thicker and have effect of emphasizing.

###Edge Detect Filter###

Edge detect filter also finds the edge of the image. But this is different with sharpen filter. While sharpen filter gives emphasize on the original image, edge detect filter makes the entire canvas color to be black and show the edge by the color of the image. This means, user can detect the edge of the image more obvious.

###Threshold Filter###

Threshold filter is one of the basic filter. This filter round up each of the color channels to the maximum of 1.0 or minimum of 0.0. So depending on whether the pixel value is greater or less than the input value, it turns black or white.

![Threshold](../Image/threshold.png "Threshold")

###Saturate Filter###

Saturate filter is also one of the simple filter. This filter simply increase or decrease the colorfulness of the image. So when the strength increase, the image or drawings become more colorful.

![Saturate](../Image/saturate.png "Saturate")

###Adjust R,G,B Filter###

Adjust R,G,B channel, so called Channels filter can control the amount of red, green blue intensity respectively. So if the user increase only the red value, the image or drawing would become more red. Same thing happens when users control the green and blue value. By controlling red, green, blue value all together, the color will become mixed that shows some cool colors.

###Quantize Filter###

Quantize filter reduce the number of colors by binning. For example, if 4 bins are used, the intensity of each color channel will space evenly by 0%, 33%, 66% and 100%.
